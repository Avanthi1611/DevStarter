        <p>For young developers, coding projects are like the final boss in a video game. They challenge you to learn vital coding skills and translate your theoretical knowledge into actual code. Besides testing your ability to recount what you’ve already learned, building simple apps will also teach you how to structure coding projects, deploy code, and debug applications once they’re live.</p>
        
        <p>The apps you build will also help you make inroads in the software industry. With enough projects under your belt, you can build a portfolio, which shows recruiters that you have both the technical skills and the passion to excel in the industry. Employers appreciate when junior developer candidates have some real-world experience, even if that experience is just projects that they’ve built in their own time.</p>
        
        <p>It can be intimidating to get started, but the best way to gain hands-on experience is to simply start coding! Building your first application (even if it’s a really simple application like your own website, a random number generator, or own chess game) is a great way to build your skills, master coding fundamentals, and your confidence. You can also look for open source projects you can join that welcomes new coders.</p>

        <h2>What Are Coding Projects?</h2>
        <p>Coding projects are simple applications built by junior developers or beginners. These apps usually have a single functionality, like a to-do list app or a random number generator. These projects are easy to conceptualize and build end-to-end as a single developer that’s at the beginning of their career. It’s the best way to impress potential employers. For example, building your own chess game or other interactive games to add to your own portfolio shows your initiative and skill set. These real-world projects can demonstrate skills in web development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, designing a user interface, or even more complex algorithms.</p>
        
        <p>Coding projects challenge you to choose the right programming language for a particular problem, map out the project architecture, and implement the features of the app. This makes coding projects the perfect introduction to programming in the real world. You can build skills through an open-source project or by completing coding bootcamps. You can build a chess game, or explore any other of the other coding projects for beginners on this list.</p>

        <h2>Coding Projects for Beginners</h2>
        
        <h3>Simple Calculator</h3>
        <p>Building a calculator is a great programming idea and one of the best coding projects for beginners. It will consist of building a display with digits from 1 to 9, mathematical operators, and a button that will produce a result on the screen.</p>

        <h3>One-Page Website</h3>
        <p>Building a one-page website is a good way to start your journey as a web developer, and it’s simple enough for new coders. To start off, you need to build a wireframe for the site. You need to conceive of each section, its position on the page, and the styles that you’ll use.</p>

        <h3>Magic 8-Ball</h3>
        <p>A magic 8-ball game uses simple programming logic, which makes it one of the most fun and engaging coding projects for beginners. The 8-ball should display a different message every time someone shakes it. So as a developer, you’re looking to associate a particular text string with a variable, and then randomly pick a particular variable every time a user shakes the ball.</p>

        <h3>Calendar</h3>
        <p>Building a calendar application is a fun way to use some of the in-built libraries that are available in the programming languages that you will use. Python has a calendar module, for example, which you can use to source data on the Gregorian calendar.</p>

        <h3>Currency Converter</h3>
        <p>Building a currency converter is a fun project that tests your ability to source data from the Internet. There are several APIs that let you source financial data, which will come in handy when building your currency converter.</p>

        <h3>Duplicate Text Checker</h3>
        <p>A duplicate text checker is a good way to learn how to parse text, which is an important skill as a software developer.</p>

        <h3>Web Scraping</h3>
        <p>Web scraping is the process of extracting data from one or multiple websites. Building a web scraper is an opportunity to start thinking about data sources and how you can collate valuable data from disparate sources.</p>

        <h3>Weather App</h3>
        <p>Building your own weather app can be a fun way to learn about how you can program apps that use data sourced from third parties.</p>

        <h3>P2P File Sharing App</h3>
        <p>This is a project that’s best for new developers who have already built a few beginner projects. The goal of this project is to allow two peers, or computers, to share files with each other.</p>

        <h3>Stock Ticker</h3>
        <p>A stock ticker is another project that will show young developers the power of using APIs. There are plenty of stock market APIs that you can choose from. All of the data that you require is available there.</p>

        <h3>YouTube Video Downloader</h3>
        <p>The features of this project are simple to envision. You can have users enter a YouTube URL, and then click a button to begin downloading the file.</p>

        <h3>Ping Pong</h3>
        <p>Building a video game is a great way to learn programming skills such as interactive features and dynamic outputs. For a beginner project, we recommend building a ping pong game.</p>

        <h2>Promoting Your Coding Projects</h2>
        <p>Once you’ve tested a project for bugs, go a step further and make your projects a part of your job hunt. Here are a few places where you can promote your projects:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Personal Website</li>
        <li>Portfolio</li>
        <li>LinkedIn</li>
        <li>Github</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Where To Get More Coding Project Ideas</h2>
        <p>There are plenty of websites and forums to find new ideas for coding projects. Some of them include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://rosettacode.org" target="_blank">Rosetta Code</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.dreamincode.net" target="_blank">Dream In Code</a></li>

        <h2>Coding Project FAQs</h2>
        <p><strong>How Much Time Should You Spend on a Programming Project?</strong></p>
        <p>Focus on your workflow and how you organize your project rather than efficiency. You will become more efficient with your time as you work on more projects.</p>

        <p><strong>How Should You Collect Feedback on Your Coding Project?</strong></p>
        <p>Show your projects to people with more experience, such as a mentor, someone with experience in the software industry. Mentors help beginner programmers by suggesting new ways to think about problems.</p>

        <p><strong>How Many Coding Projects Should You Do as a New Programmer?</strong></p>
        <p>Work through projects until you feel confident in your ability to build applications. Make sure your projects get a little more complex each time to challenge yourself to learn new things.</p>
